### Abstract:

This report presents a comprehensive structural study of PTEN (Phosphatase and tensin homolog), a critical tumor suppressor enzyme known for its dual phosphatase activity. The study aims to elucidate the molecular architecture of PTEN, focusing on its phosphatase domain, and to understand the enzyme's catalytic site and the corresponding enzymatic activity. Utilizing advanced structural biology and bioinformatics tools, we have identified key residues involved in PTEN's enzymatic activity, including Cys124, Arg130, and His93, Lys125, Lys128, and Val45, which are crucial for substrate binding and catalysis. This study provide insights into residues that could have role in the hydrolysis (dephosphorylation) reaction caried out by PTEN. Our findings reveal the structural similarities between PTEN and other proteins, such as Tensin and auxilin, suggesting an evolutionary conservation of these structural features. This paper was able to provide a docking structure that represent PTEN protein bound to the IP3 ligand and validate the structure through different tools. Despite these advances, several aspects of PTEN's structure and function remain unresolved, including the exact nature of its dimeric structure and the roles of its various hotspot residues. This study underscores the complexity of PTEN's regulation and the need for continued research to fully understand its role in cellular processes and disease, particularly cancer. The implications of our findings for the development of targeted therapies for cancer are discussed, highlighting the potential of PTEN as a therapeutic target.
